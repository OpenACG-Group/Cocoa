## QResource - Quick Resources Serialization

QResource is a series of tools which can serialize (deserialize) and compress (decompress)
files and directories into a `.crpkg` file.
**crpkg** is a compressed virtual filesystem format based on `squashfs`. Consequently, a
_crpkg archive_ (aka _crpkg image_) can be decompressed and extracted by tools provided by
`squashfs`.
