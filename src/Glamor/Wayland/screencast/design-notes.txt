Using org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop service to share screen under Wayland:

0. Connect to DBus

1. Call org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast.CreateSession to create a new session
   => Signal org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Response will be emitted when creation finishes

2. [in signal handler] Call org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast.SelectSources to select sources
   => Signal org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Response will be emitted when sources have been selected

3. [in signal handler] Call org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast.Start to start screencast
   => Signal org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Response will be emitted when starting finishes;
      We also can get a number which represents a pipewire node

4. [in signal handler] Call org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast.OpenPipeWireRemote to open pipewire
   => When this method is returned, we will receive a file descriptor `fd`

5. Use the received `fd` to connect to pipewire

6. Create a pipewire video stream on that pipewire node
